  <h2>About LEV</h2>
  <p>
   LEV – Eco Village is an intentional community in Costa Rica rooted in regenerative living, shared values, and a deep respect for the natural world. 
    Set within a lush tropical landscape, LEV is designed as a place where people can live lightly on the land while building meaningful connections with each other.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    At LEV, we believe that sustainable living is not only about ecological responsibility, but also about community, creativity, and personal growth. 
    Our village is shaped around principles of permaculture, thoughtful design, and cooperation — creating a balanced environment that supports both individual autonomy and 
    collective wellbeing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Life at LEV invites a slower, more conscious rhythm. Residents and visitors alike are encouraged to engage with the land, participate in shared activities, and contribute their 
    skills and ideas to the evolving fabric of the community. From shared meals and collaborative projects to quiet moments in nature, LEV offers space for both connection and 
    reflection.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Whether you are seeking a long-term home, a place to learn and grow, or a temporary retreat immersed in nature, LEV – Eco Village offers a living example of what is possible 
    when people come together with intention, care, and respect for the Earth.

    where people, land, and community evolve together. We seek to create a living example
    of what is possible when ecological responsibility, cooperation, and shared purpose
    form the foundation of daily life.

    rich and vibrant landscape, the village offers a way of living that balances individual
    freedom with collective care.

    Community life is woven through simple, meaningful experiences: shared meals made from
    locally grown food, collaborative projects on the land, creative workshops, and
    spontaneous conversations that turn neighbors into friends. Participation is
    encouraged but never forced, allowing each person to engage in ways that feel natural
    and aligned.

    nature, life at La Ecovilla invites presence, contribution, and reflection. It is a
    place where people come not just to live, but to grow — together, and in harmony with
    the land that supports them.
