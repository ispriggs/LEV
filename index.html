    About LEV – Eco Village

LEV – Eco Village is an intentional community in Costa Rica rooted in regenerative living, shared values, and a deep respect for the natural world. Set within a lush tropical landscape, LEV is designed as a place where people can live lightly on the land while building meaningful connections with each other.

    At LEV, we believe that sustainable living is not only about ecological responsibility, but also about community, creativity, and personal growth. Our village is shaped around principles of permaculture, thoughtful design, and cooperation — creating a balanced environment that supports both individual autonomy and collective wellbeing.

    Life at LEV invites a slower, more conscious rhythm. Residents and visitors alike are encouraged to engage with the land, participate in shared activities, and contribute their skills and ideas to the evolving fabric of the community. From shared meals and collaborative projects to quiet moments in nature, LEV offers space for both connection and reflection.

    Whether you are seeking a long-term home, a place to learn and grow, or a temporary retreat immersed in nature, LEV – Eco Village offers a living example of what is possible when people come together with intention, care, and respect for the Earth.
