  <h2>About LEV</h2>
  <p>
   LEV – Eco Village is an intentional community in Costa Rica rooted in regenerative living, shared values, and a deep respect for the natural world. 
    Set within a lush tropical landscape, LEV is designed as a place where people can live lightly on the land while building meaningful connections with each other.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    At LEV, we believe that sustainable living is not only about ecological responsibility, but also about community, creativity, and personal growth. 
    Our village is shaped around principles of permaculture, thoughtful design, and cooperation — creating a balanced environment that supports both individual autonomy and 
    collective wellbeing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Life at LEV invites a slower, more conscious rhythm. Residents and visitors alike are encouraged to engage with the land, participate in shared activities, and contribute their 
    skills and ideas to the evolving fabric of the community. From shared meals and collaborative projects to quiet moments in nature, LEV offers space for both connection and 
    reflection.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Whether you are seeking a long-term home, a place to learn and grow, or a temporary retreat immersed in nature, LEV – Eco Village offers a living example of what is possible 
    when people come together with intention, care, and respect for the Earth.

    where people, land, and community evolve together. We seek to create a living example
    of what is possible when ecological responsibility, cooperation, and shared purpose
    form the foundation of daily life.

  <h2>Useful Information</h2>

  <p class="vision-intro">
    Living in Costa Rica — and within an eco village — is a deeply rewarding experience,
    but it comes with its own rhythms, systems, and expectations. This section offers
    practical insights to help residents and visitors feel grounded, prepared, and at home.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Life in Costa Rica</h3>
      <p>
        Costa Rica operates at a slower, relationship-centered pace often referred to as
        <em>“Pura Vida.”</em> Patience, flexibility, and respect go a long way — whether
        navigating local services, transportation, or daily interactions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Climate & Nature</h3>
      <p>
        Expect warm temperatures year-round, a lush green rainy season, and abundant
        wildlife. Living close to nature means embracing rain, insects, and changing
        conditions as part of the experience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Eco-Village Living</h3>
      <p>
        Life at LEV values shared responsibility, open communication, and mindful resource
        use. Residents are encouraged to participate in community activities while
        respecting personal boundaries and diverse lifestyles.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Resources & Self-Reliance</h3>
      <p>
        Eco village life often involves alternative systems such as rainwater collection,
        composting, and renewable energy. Awareness and care help ensure these systems
        remain resilient and sustainable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Health & Wellbeing</h3>

        daily practices.
